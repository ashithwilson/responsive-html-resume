# Responsive HTML5 Resume

## Overview

This repository contains my resume developed in responsive HTML5 along with vanila CSS.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The resume layout adjusts dynamically to fit various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Two-Column Layout**: Implemented using CSS, the resume features a professional and visually appealing two-column design, enhancing readability and organization.
- **Print Styles**: I've included print-specific CSS styles to ensure that the resume prints cleanly on standard A4 sheets, maintaining proper formatting and layout.

## Usage

To view or edit the resume:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the resume.
3. Edit the HTML and CSS files as needed using a text editor to make modifications or updates.

## Rationale

### Portability and Ease of Editing

I wanted my resume to be easily editable from anywhere without relying on specific software. HTML5 allows me to edit my resume using just a text editor and a web browser, making it highly portable and convenient for quick updates on the go.

### Customization

I desired a two-column layout for my resume, which wasn't easily achievable using platforms like Google Docs due to their limitations. While LaTeX is a powerful tool for document creation, I preferred to avoid learning it just for a single page resume. 

With this I turned to my rusty web dev skills using HTML5 and CSS, allowing me to focus on crafting content rather than learning a new markup language. By utilizing HTML5 and CSS, I have full control over the layout and design, ensuring that my resume looks exactly as I envision it across different devices and screen sizes.
